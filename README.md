# Airline Booking Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive **Airline Booking Analysis** dashboard built in Excel to explore passenger behavior, booking channels, trip types, and global demand.

## Overview

The dashboard provides a single view of:

- Total number of passengers
- Booking behavior by trip type and number of passengers
- Conversion rate by sales channel
- Booking volume by day and hour
- Passenger preferences (extra baggage, preferred seats, in‑flight meals)
- Geographic distribution of passengers across countries

It helps airlines and travel teams understand when, where, and how people book flights.

## Key Metrics & KPIs

- **Total Number of Passengers**  
- **Percentage wanting extra baggage**  
- **Percentage preferring specific seats**  
- **Percentage wanting in‑flight meals**  

These KPIs are shown as summary cards to give a quick snapshot of customer preferences.

## Visualizations
